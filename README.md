## A mod for the game Stardew Valley that allows the player to gift special hats to NPCs.
# By Tabitha Rowland

### Features
Use and add your own custom hats to gift to NPCs in Stardew Valley. These hats are 

### Installation

### Adding Your Own Hats
**Requirements:** a ==16x64== png file of your hat art including 4 rederings of the hat. The png is made of 4 16x16 squares. These follow the following order: front, left side, back, right side.

To add your own hat art to the game, 
1. Open the file hat-registry.json in whatever editor is easy for you. Notepad will work fine. 
2. Refrencing the format of other hat names in hat-registry.json, add the name of your file and an ID number to go along with it. 400+ is recommended. 
3. Place a copy of your 16x64 png file into the assets folder. Exit the game if open. Next time you boot up the game, your hat should be available to gift to NPCs!

### Limitations
You can only have custom hat options equal to the amount of slots in a chest (36). Follow **Adding Your Own Hats** but delete a file rather than add one to remove excess hats hats. 

### Bugs
